# JavaScript Capstone project

With this project we improve the performance for the database.

## Images for performance comparison

## Built With

- PostgreSQL
- VS Code

### Prerequisites

 - Postgres
 - PG Admin
 - Terminal

### Usage

 Clone the project by typing in your terminal `https://github.com/kensayo/vetClinicSQL.git`.
